## Key Technical Decisions

### Authentication Strategy
- **Web Interface**: Optional JWT-based authentication (skipped if no admin credentials in env)
- **Proxy Support**: Auth can be disabled for reverse proxy authentication
- **MCP Server**: API key authentication using MCP_API_KEY from environment
- **Token Storage**: JWT in httpOnly cookies (when auth enabled)
- **Admin Configuration**: ADMIN_EMAIL/ADMIN_PASSWORD via environment variables

### Database Design
- **Primary Database**: PostgreSQL with JSONB for flexible platform data
- **Connection Pooling**: SQLAlchemy with asyncpg for async operations
- **Migration Management**: Alembic for schema versioning

### Platform Integration
- **Steam First**: Start with Steam Web API as primary platform
- **Steam Integration Depth**: Include playtime, achievements, ratings, and maturity data
- **Data Enrichment**: Steam API as primary metadata source
- **Future Platforms**: Architecture supports easy addition of other platforms

### API Architecture
- **Backend**: FastAPI with async/await throughout
- **Frontend**: React with Vite, React Router v7, shadcn/ui components
- **State Management**: React Query for server state, Context for auth only
- **Real-time**: Socket.IO for sync progress and notifications
- **Documentation**: Auto-generated OpenAPI specs

## Success Criteria

Phase 1 will be considered successful when:

- [ ] **Steam Library Sync**: Complete end-to-end Steam library synchronization
- [ ] **MCP Server Functional**: All core tools working with external MCP clients
- [ ] **Web Interface**: Basic library browsing and platform management
- [ ] **Game Metadata**: Comprehensive Steam metadata integration working
- [ ] **Authentication**: Secure admin access to web interface
- [ ] **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket sync progress working

## Testing Strategy

**Testing Scope**: Basic unit tests for core functionality with automated MCP tool testing

### Unit Tests
- [ ] Database model tests
- [ ] Steam integration tests
- [ ] Steam metadata enrichment tests
- [ ] MCP tool function tests
- [ ] API endpoint tests
- [ ] Authentication flow tests

### Integration Tests
- [ ] End-to-end Steam sync flow
- [ ] MCP server tool responses
- [ ] Web interface user flows
- [ ] Database migration tests
- [ ] External API integration tests

### Manual Testing
- [ ] Steam API connection and comprehensive data fetching
- [ ] MCP client connection (Claude Desktop)
- [ ] Web interface usability and data presentation
- [ ] Steam metadata enhancement accuracy
- [ ] Error handling and recovery

## Development Workflow

### Environment Setup
```bash
# Initial setup
make setup

# Start development environment
make dev

# Run tests
make test

# Database operations
make db-migrate
make db-seed
```

### Service Development Order
1. **RAWG Cleanup** - Remove all RAWG references from existing code/docs
2. **Database Setup** - Get PostgreSQL running with schema
3. **MCP Server** - Core functionality for AI integration
4. **Steam Integration** - Comprehensive Steam API integration with metadata enhancement
5. **Web Backend** - FastAPI with environment-based authentication
6. **Web Frontend** - React interface (functional but architecturally sound)
7. **Integration** - Connect all services together

## Notes

### Phase 1 Focus
- **Steam Only**: Focus entirely on Steam platform (defer other platforms)
- **Comprehensive Steam Data**: Include all available data (games, playtime, achievements, ratings)
- **Steam Metadata**: Rich game metadata from Steam's native APIs
- **Functional UI**: Basic but well-architected interface for future polish
- **Local Development**: All services running locally via Docker Compose
- **Environment-Based Auth**: Configurable admin credentials

### External Dependencies
- **Steam Web API Key**: Required for Steam integration and metadata
- **Environment Variables**: Admin credentials configurable via .env

### Performance Considerations
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement for all external API calls
- **Caching**: Redis for session data and API response caching
- **Database Indexes**: Optimize for search and filtering operations
- **Connection Pooling**: Proper database connection management

### Security Considerations
- **API Keys**: Secure storage and rotation capability
- **JWT Secrets**: Strong secret key generation
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs properly validated
- **SQL Injection**: Use parameterized queries throughout
- **CORS**: Proper configuration for web interface
- **Proxy Support**: Optional auth for reverse proxy scenarios

### Frontend Technical Decisions
- **UI Library**: shadcn/ui (copy-paste components, not a dependency)
- **Routing**: React Router v7 with data loaders
- **Data Fetching**: React Query with stale-while-revalidate
- **Real-time**: Socket.IO client with automatic reconnection
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Testing**: Vitest + React Testing Library

## Next Steps After Phase 1

Once Phase 1 is complete, Phase 2 will focus on:
1. **AI Service Integration** - LangChain agent with Ollama
2. **Enhanced Web Features** - AI chat interface and analytics
3. **Advanced MCP Tools** - Smarter recommendations and insights
4. **Performance Optimization** - Caching, background jobs, optimizations

This phase establishes the foundational infrastructure needed for all future development and proves the core concept with a working single-platform system.
