# Phase 0: Foundation & Development Setup

**Goal:** Set up development environment and basic project structure

## Progress Tracker

### 0.1 Project Setup ✓
- [x] Initialize project structure and Git repository
- [x] Create `.env.example` with all required variables  
- [x] Set up development docker-compose.yml
- [x] Create basic README with quickstart instructions
- [x] Add `.gitignore` for Python/Node/Docker artifacts

### 0.2 Makefile-Driven Development
- [ ] Create comprehensive Makefile with targets:
  - [ ] `make setup` - Install all dependencies and tools
  - [ ] `make dev` - Start development environment
  - [ ] `make test` - Run all tests
  - [ ] `make lint` - Run linters (ruff, black, eslint)
  - [ ] `make build` - Build all Docker images
  - [ ] `make clean` - Clean up artifacts
  - [ ] `make db-migrate` - Run database migrations
  - [ ] `make db-seed` - Seed test data
- [ ] VSCode workspace settings and recommended extensions
- [ ] Pre-commit hooks configuration

### 0.3 Database Schema & Migrations
- [ ] Design complete database schema
- [ ] Create initial migration scripts
- [ ] Set up Alembic for schema versioning
- [ ] Create seed data for testing
- [ ] Document database relationships

### 0.4 API Specifications
- [ ] Define OpenAPI schemas for all services
- [ ] Document MCP tool specifications
- [ ] Create example requests/responses
- [ ] Define WebSocket event formats
- [ ] Error code standardization

### 0.5 Basic CI/CD
- [ ] Simple GitHub Actions for tests and linting
- [ ] Docker image building workflow
- [ ] Basic health check scripts
- [ ] Backup/restore scripts for homelab use
- [ ] Simple deployment checklist

## Notes

### Project Structure
The project structure has already been defined in the implementation plan:
```
game-djinn/
├── docker-compose.yml
├── .env.example
├── Makefile
├── README.md
├── services/
│   ├── web/
│   ├── mcp-server/
│   ├── ai-service/
│   └── platform-sync/
├── database/
├── scripts/
└── docs/
```

### Key Decisions
- Using Makefile as the central development tool
- FastAPI for all backend services
- PostgreSQL with JSONB for flexible platform data
- Official MCP Python SDK for the MCP server
- Simple JWT auth for homelab use (single admin user)

### Next Steps After Phase 0
Once Phase 0 is complete, we'll move to Phase 1 which focuses on:
1. Database setup with the designed schema
2. Platform integration foundation (starting with Steam)
3. MCP server implementation
4. Basic web interface

### Useful Commands (once Makefile is created)
```bash
# Initial setup
make setup

# Start development environment
make dev

# Run tests and linting
make test
make lint

# Database operations
make db-migrate
make db-seed
```
